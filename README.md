Just for screening test

This app is developed using AngularJS 2.0, Bootstrap 3, HTML5, & CSS3. Here we are fetching the json and showing the details.

If extra time was permitted, I would have showed the issue details when click on open issues. Moreover i would have focussed more on UI in order to make it more responsive and interactive.
